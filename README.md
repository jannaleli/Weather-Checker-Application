# 5 day forecast

"Build a single HTML page displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a location of your choice."

## My Solution

The app is developed on top of Swift 4 using Native iOS APIs such as UIKit and Foundation



## Technology Stack

* iOS
* Swift 4
* [OpenWeatherMap 5 day forecast](http://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

```
Questions

# Better User Experience for iOS Users
* Make the text legible, readable, and provide more clarity by bringing the text in the forefront of the application. As the application provides information regarding the weather, make the text pop up more by making use of more muted colors and less use of images for less clutter.
* With the use of metaphors to create a more simulated feeling of reality when someone is interacting with your apps. Probably make use of imagery or other multimedia factors that would simulate a rainy weather or a good sunny day. When the user swipes right for a detailed view of the weather, the preceding screen would have the feel of the actual weather for that particular day maybe by using the Sun as the metaphor.
* Since we are dealing with information loaded onto the UI, there should be considerations for progress loading in every step of the way especially if we need information from a third-party API. Since it involves waiting for information, this should be a factor. We should make the user feel like they're not waiting for the loading of information.
* Provide accessibility for iPhone users who prefer to have larger texts displayed on screen. Especially since we are dealing with chunks of texts, the app should make sure that the texts are able to change accordingly to user preference.
* Lessen the navigation as much as possible by providing two main screens for the weather app, one is for weather summary and the second screen will be for the detailed weather.


# If I had more time...

### Create a detailed view of the app
If I had more time to develop the project, I will make sure to add a more detailed view. Right now I only have the main screen which lists down the summary of weather for each date.
Add some bits and bobs of multimedia. Due to the lack of time, I have not been able to work on the UI as much. 

### Test Cases
Spend more in creating test case for the applications.

### Code
I will create App Constants that would enable the readability of the application

### Loading

During the first launch of the application, provide a way for user to choose location and make sure the application remembers the particular information for the second opening of the application.

### Search for location
Add a location such as in the Apple Weather App where a user can monitor multiple locations.
